## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

**Challenges**
 --- | ---
1. | Being new to git it was difficult to understand every step and how to proceed. Often scared as anything wrong may be done and then correcting it will become an issue.
2. | Making the makefile was a challenge.  
3. | Making diagrams for High Level and Low level Requirements and what to include in it was a challenge too.
4. | I was making the **Swot Analysis table** manually from paint. 

**How was it Overcome**
--- | ---
1. | Learnt each and every concept slowly and **Visual Studio Code** was a great relief and a big help initially to proceed.
2. | Asked company friends and they helped me in it.
3. | Searched on the net about what should be included and made it accordingly.
4. | A company friend suggested me an online method to make it. Thanks to his help it got finished early than expected.
